			<h1>We focus on transparency and trust</h1>
			
			<p>
				Car One Auto focuses on transparency and trust with our customers, ensuring our commitment in providing the highest quality cars and services to our customers. Established since 2008, we have gained our experience in the local car market through umpteen transactions. Our idea is that in order to have happy and satisfied customers, we not only need to provide value for money but also a honest and transparent transaction. We strong believe that if customers are provided with clear and properly spelt out terms of purchase, they will be able to understand and hence prevent further misunderstanding and confusion later on.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>			
			<p>Your satisfaction is our priority. Nothing is more important to us than having a happy customer. Happy customers will help us spread the word and recommend our services and promote our values to their peers. This is the state we want, and we do our very best to achieve such results. We believe that weakness in customer communications is the main source of any form of unhappiness in this trade, we therefore pride ourselves on our responsiveness when it comes to customer enquiries.</p>
			
			<h3>Responsibility of Quality</h3>			
			<p>Empty promises are common in this trade, it is also one of the main reasons why some people are unhappy with their purchase. Whatever that was promised was not completed and delivered, it results in the customer feeling that they have overpaid for their purchase. Recognising this as a problem, our sales person are trained to sell responsibly and not simply utter out promises we cannot keep. This way, we will be able to be responsible for the quality of cars we sell and give an honest deal to our valued customers.</p>
